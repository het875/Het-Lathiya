about me : 
Passionate Python developer with expertise in financial systems and innovative problem-solving

Detail-oriented and motivated Python Developer with a strong interest in backend development and
data-driven systems. I specialize in building efficient APIs, automating tasks through web scraping,
and developing robust data pipelines using Python frameworks like Django and FastAPI. With solid
problem-solving skills in algorithms and database design, I aim to contribute to high-impact projects
that require clean architecture, maintainable code, and scalable backend solutions. Iâ€™m particularly
interested in roles involving real-time data processing, web scraping automation, and RESTful API
design in fast-moving tech environments.

My journey began with comprehensive backend python training, where I mastered Python, Django, and MySQL. During this phase, I developed key projects including an rental cloth platform django app.

I then transitioned into professional development, specializing in web backend & financial systems. Over the past year, I've worked extensively with FastAPI, web scraping, and real-time data processing technologies, gaining deep expertise in financial protocols and trading systems.

What sets me apart is my approach to problem-solving: I always explore multiple solution paths for every challenge, ensuring the most efficient and innovative implementation.
